# pinger method selection can be any of:
# fping - round robin pinging (rtts)
# fping-ts - round robin pinging using ICMP type 13 (owds)
# tsping - round robin pinging using ICMP type 13 (owds)

# list of reflectors to use and number of pingers to initiate
# pingers will be initiated with reflectors in the order specified in the list
# additional reflectors will be used to replace any reflectors that go stale
# so e.g. if 6 reflectors are specified and the number of pingers is set to 4, the first 4 reflectors will be used initially
# and the remaining 2 reflectors in the list will be used in the event any of the first 4 go bad
# a bad reflector will go to the back of the queue on reflector rotation

### In multi-homed setups, it is mandatory to use either ping_extra_args
### or ping_prefix_string to direct the pings through $dl_if and $ul_if.
### No universal recommendation exists, because there are multiple
### policy-routing packages available (e.g. vpn-policy-routing and mwan3).
### Typically they either react to a firewall mark set on the pings, or
### provide a convenient wrapper.
###
### In a traditional single-homed setup, there is usually no need for these parameters.
###
### These arguments can also be used for any other purpose - e.g. for setting a
### particular QoS mark.

# extra arguments for ping or fping
# e.g., here is how you can set the correct outgoing interface and
# the firewall mark for ping:
# ping_extra_args="-I wwan0 -m $((0x300))"
# Unfortunately, fping does not offer a command line switch to set
# the firewall mark.
# WARNING: no error checking so use at own risk!
ping_extra_args=""

# a wrapper for ping binary - used as a prefix for the real command
# e.g., when using mwan3, it is recommended to set it like this:
# ping_prefix_string="mwan3 use gpon exec"
# WARNING: the wrapper must exec ping as the final step, not run it as a subprocess.
# Running ping or fping as a subprocess will lead to problems stopping it.
# WARNING: no error checking - so use at own risk!
